# Team-based projects
#### LazyCube (2023) - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lazy.lazycubeapp&gl=GB
  - Seven member group project in second academic year - Achieved second place.
  - Objective was to design an app that could scan and solve a Rubik's cube seamlessly.
  - Delivered an Android app that scanned a Rubik's cube in real-time using TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Model which then solved it via our logic in Java. We regularly consulted our stakeholder to update them on its progress and future development.
  - Used SCRUM agile project management methodology alongside Jira to manage our workload.
  - Main contributions include the app's logic in Java, app design and partial functionality in Android Studio and taking the role of team admin where I would log our meetings, summarise our workload and be responsible for enhancing the team's collaboration efforts.
#### R Mock Relief Case-Study (2024)
  - Originally three member group project, reduced to two.
  - Objective was to create a report including a combination of interactive and non-interactive visuals to discuss our findings of how we could potentially relieve a fictional location after a natural disaster.
  - Visuals were created with a combination of R and the Observable notebook which uses JavaScript, with a range of graphs e.g. bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots.
  - Partner and I would meet two times a week to discuss our approaches and analysis of the data, while distributing our work between the visuals and the written report.
#### Quality Assurance Report (2024)
  - Six member group project
  - Objective was to create a website and create tests for users to carry out and report back their findings for us to discuss how we could improve the website.
  - Website was a simple fitness tracker using NodeJS and Firebase.
  - Contributed to the user profile page and working with Firebase.
  - Final deliverable was a report and presentation of our project management, approach, quality assurance tests, ethics and potential improvements, alongside a personal retrospective on the team and our improvements.
